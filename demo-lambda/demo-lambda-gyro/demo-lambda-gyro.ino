SFE_LSM9DS1 Library Simple Example Code - I2C Interface

The LSM9DS1 is a versatile 9DOF sensor. It has a built-in
accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Very cool! Plus it
functions over either SPI or I2C.

This Arduino sketch is a demo of the simple side of the
SFE_LSM9DS1 library. It'll demo the following:
* How to create a LSM9DS1 object, using a constructor (global
  variables section).
* How to use the begin() function of the LSM9DS1 class.
* How to read the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer
  using the readGryo(), readAccel(), readMag() functions and 
  the gx, gy, gz, ax, ay, az, mx, my, and mz variables.
* How to calculate actual acceleration, rotation speed, 
  magnetic field strength using the calcAccel(), calcGyro() 
  and calcMag() functions.
* How to use the data from the LSM9DS1 to calculate 
  orientation and heading.

Hardware setup: This library supports communicating with the
LSM9DS1 over either I2C or SPI. This example demonstrates how
to use I2C. The pin-out is as follows:
  LSM9DS1 --------- Arduino
   SCL ---------- SCL (A5 on older 'Duinos')
   SDA ---------- SDA (A4 on older 'Duinos')
   VDD ------------- 3.3V
   GND ------------- GND
(CSG, CSXM, SDOG, and SDOXM should all be pulled high. 
Jumpers on the breakout board will do this for you.)

The LSM9DS1 has a maximum voltage of 3.6V. Make sure you power it
off the 3.3V rail! I2C pins are open-drain, so you'll be 
(mostly) safe connecting the LSM9DS1's SCL and SDA pins 
directly to the Arduino.

Development environment specifics:
  IDE: Arduino 1.6.3
  Hardware Platform: SparkFun Redboard
  LSM9DS1 Breakout Version: 1.0

This code is beerware. If you see me (or any other SparkFun 
employee) at the local, and you've found our code helpful, 
please buy us a round!
